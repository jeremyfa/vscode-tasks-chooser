# Tasks chooser

Allow to choose tasks and change default build command from status bar.

Everything is configured from a single JSON file located at `.vscode/tasks-chooser.json` (relative to your workspace root).
You can see an example at [example/.vscode/tasks-chooser.json](https://github.com/jeremyfa/vscode-tasks-chooser/tree/master/example/.vscode/tasks-chooser.json).

### Status

The extension is working but will be tested for a while, and documented, before it hits the vscode marketplace.

Meanwhile you can always use this extension by cloning the repository into your `.vscode/extensions/` directory.
